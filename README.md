# About Projects
This project is a simple yet modern blog page designed with a strong focus on responsiveness and user experience.
Built using Bootstrap, the layout automatically adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless browsing experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Each blog post is displayed with a clean and attractive card layout that includes a title, an image, a short description, and a "Read More" button to encourage user engagement. 
A key feature of the interface is the dark mode toggle, which enhances visual comfort during low-light conditions and caters to user preferences. 
The implementation follows good UX principles, emphasizing readability, accessibility, and intuitive navigation. 
This blog page serves as a solid foundation for any personal or portfolio blog, demonstrating both front-end design skills and responsiveness best practices.
